# fchat-realtime-chatapp
fChat is a sleek and efficient real-time chat application designed to streamline communication and foster connections.

Some Features of This App:
Tech stack: MERN + Socket.io + TailwindCSS + Daisy UI
Authentication && Authorization with JWT
Real-time messaging with Socket.io
Online user status (Socket.io and React Context)
Global state management with Zustand
Error handling both on the server and on the client

Frontend:

React.js: The frontend is likely built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, which is beneficial for building a complex application like a chat app.
TailwindCSS with Daisy UI: TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes for styling. Daisy UI is a collection of reusable components built on top of TailwindCSS, which helps in creating a sleek and modern UI.
Zustand: Zustand is a lightweight state management library for React. It provides a simple way to manage global application state without the complexity of Redux or MobX.
Socket.io: Socket.io is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between web clients and servers. It's commonly used for building real-time features like chat applications.
Backend:

Node.js with Express.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications and APIs.
MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It's commonly used with Node.js applications due to its scalability and flexibility.
Socket.io: The backend also utilizes Socket.io for real-time communication with clients. Socket.io allows the server to emit events to connected clients and vice versa, enabling real-time messaging functionality.
JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for authentication and authorization. When a user logs in, they receive a JWT, which they include in subsequent requests to authenticate themselves.
Features:

Real-time Messaging: Socket.io facilitates real-time messaging between users, allowing them to send and receive messages instantly.
Online User Status: Socket.io and React Context are likely used to track the online status of users. When a user connects to the chat application, their status is updated in real-time, allowing others to see if they're online.
Error Handling: Error handling is implemented both on the server and the client to ensure smooth operation of the application. This likely involves validating user inputs, handling server errors gracefully, and providing informative error messages to users.
